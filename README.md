Term project: Basic Petri net model for a MIPS simulator
This project implements a basic Petri Net simulator for a simplified MIPS Processor.
The model uses colored tokens (token with values) rather than the default Petri net.
Simulator is expected to generate step-by-step simulation of the Petri net model of the MIPS processor.
